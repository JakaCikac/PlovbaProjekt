# PlovbaProjekt

A project for "Interaction and information visualization" course at the Faculty of Computer Science, University of Ljubljana.

The project goal is to design a virtual rowing environment that can be controlled by a real person rowing. The detection of rowing is done by Kinect V1 (using Gestures). 

To implement the UI, Unity 5 was used in combination with C#.


The Gesture recognition is loosely based on the code avaialble in an Unity Store Asset "Kinect with MS-SDK". Tha character in the UI is also a part of this asset.
